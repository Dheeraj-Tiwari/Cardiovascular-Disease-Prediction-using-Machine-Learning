## Abstract
CVDs have continued to be a major cause of mortality and morbidity globally and hence there is a need to identify them early and to consider accurate risk prediction models. The usual diagnostic techniques may raise accuracy and dependability of findings but are time-consuming and may not give initial indications of diseases. The recent development in the field of data science has led to the application of sophisticated ML techniques in the computerized diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases with the help of clinical and lifestyle data. This study looks at the feasibility of six machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVC, KNN, Perceptron, and Random Forest on a realistic dataset for estimating the probability of CVD occurrence. This dataset is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and includes clinical attributes like person’s age and gender, cholesterol, blood pressure, smoking profiles or alcohol consumptions, physical activity and exercise, and other related characteristics as well as a binary target variable for cardiovascular disease, 1 signifies the person has cardiovascular diseases and 0 for the contrary.

To clean the data for machine learning purposes, techniques such as handling missing values, feature scaling, outlier removal and categorical variables encoding were done. Preprocessing was performed along with a selection of the relevant features, using the mutual information gain for feature selection and correlation analysis in order to reduce the number of features for model training down to 15. The performance of each of the six models was measured on the same set of metrics including accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score after they were trained on the processed data. The unconstrained and constrained models were also compared in terms of their training and testing loss, accuracy respectively, and finally their generalization performance and robustness.

From the findings, it is clear that ensemble learning Reduced Error introduced the best performing method- Random Forest, with testing accuracy of 70.85%. RF was also superior in training stability and robustness indicating it could be applied to real-world settings for cardiovascular disease risk prediction. The Decision Tree with a testing accuracy of 69,94% presented high results as well, however, KNN and Perceptron demonstrated worse performance caused by problems of over-learning and dependency on the training dataset. Micro- and macro-averages were employed to measure the performance of models and reveal the interchangeability between the false-positive and false-negative cases especially when used in cases of imbalanced data sets, the precision-recall curves, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.

Besides model evaluation, the models’ computational efficiency was also measured in terms of execution time on different platforms: CPU, GPU, TPU. The test showed that the TPU had the highest throughput when running the model, 25.7% of the time faster than the CPU, which means that the use of dedicated hardware can signification improve the models training and inference especially when dealing with a large amount of data with complex models.

This paper adds to the specialty of the literature in the utilization of machine learning for healthcare though the provision of innovative tutorial on cardiovascular sickness prediction. The study indicates that the application of machine learning models including Random Forest in identifying earlier signs of cardiovascular diseases is very promising for the assistance of medical personnel. Future work will involve analyzing deep learning algorithms and incorporating other datasets, including the real-time health measurements from the wearable gadgets, to improve the prediction models and to apply the presented models for clinical practice purposes.
